## Introduction to Application

Park Guardian App: Environmental Issue Reporter

London is a surprisingly green city, with around 3,000 parks and a vibrant network of canals, reservoirs, and riversides to explore. While enjoying the park, it's worth considering how we can contribute to and enhance our parks and green spaces, and ways to get involved.
The App enables you to report environmental concerns in the Parks. If you come across something such as flying-tipping, dog mess, or a dirty street that requires reporting, open the app, locate automatically, easily fill in the required information to report it to the relevant authorities in a five-step process.Step one to locate the issue; step two to choose the issue category; step three to briefly describe the issue; step four to submit the report and finally to review all historical reports in the My Report Profile.
